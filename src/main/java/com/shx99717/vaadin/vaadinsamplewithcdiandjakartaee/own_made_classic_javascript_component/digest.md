# How to integrate a self-contained own-made old classic javascript component with Vaadin Flow e.g. image viewer
- We do not want to web-componenize the old javascript
- We do not want to moduluize the old javascript to compatible with ES module and therefore could be loaded by @JSModule annotation, read com.shx99717.vaadin.vaadinsamplewithcdiandjakartaee.web_component_1/digest.md

Please refer to the conceptual project [vaadin-flow-component-with-classic-javascript](https://github.com/shx99717/vaadin-flow-component-with-classic-javascript)

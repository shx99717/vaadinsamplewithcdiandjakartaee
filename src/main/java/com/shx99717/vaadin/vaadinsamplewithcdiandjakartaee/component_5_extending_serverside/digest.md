You can create a new component by extending any existing component.
For most components, there is a client-side component and a corresponding server-side component:
- Client-side component: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and defines a set of properties that determine the behavior of the component on the client side.
- Server-side component: Contains Java code that allows for changing of the client-side properties, and manages the component behavior on the server side.

You can extend a component on either the server or client side. Note that these are alternative approaches that are mutually exclusive.

Vaadin client-side components are based on Polymer 3 that supports extending existing components. You can use the extends property to extend existing Polymer elements.

There are five ways to inherit a template from another Polymer element:
1. Inheriting a base class template without modifying it.
2. Overriding a base class template in a child class.
3. Modifying a copy of a superclass template.
4. Extending a base class template in a child class.
5. Providing template-extension points in a base class for content from a child class.

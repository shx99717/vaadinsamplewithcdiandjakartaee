A custom theme can extend another custom theme by configuring a “parent theme” in theme.json. 
This can be useful for splitting your styles into a base theme shared by all applications, 
and multiple “sub-themes” for different applications or sub-brands. The parent theme can be in the same project
 as the sub-theme, or in a separate dependency.
 
The example showing here is, the parent theme is located in a separate jar, the theme in this folder extends the
parent theme, the CSS loading sequence is:

With a parent and sub theme configuration like this, the CSS load order is as follows:
1. Lumo styles
2. Parent theme styles --- my-theme
3. Sub-theme styles --- my-extended-theme
4. Manually loaded additional style sheets (for example, using @CssImport in Flow)
   for @CssImport, it can only import the styles under frontend folder of the client/current/target project, there is 
   no way to @CssImport the file in a separate jar, e.g. from the my-theme jar
